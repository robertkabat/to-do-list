## MLP To-DO - quick summary

**1. Installation**

Easiest way to boot up the project is to use Laravel Sail.

```php
    composer install
    npm install
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
```

Or something like that let's hope!

**2. What is not in the project?**

There is no user related code seeing as this is just a quick demo.

**3. Summary** 

Lot more fun stuff could go into that project, however I didn't want to make you to go through all this code review! Also, I wanted
to note that normally, in bigger projects I would build up and polish presented solutions
into much nicer structure. I would probably also justify using Redis. I like Redis.
